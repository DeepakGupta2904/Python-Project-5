Project: - IRIS Flower Classification.

I am done this project at CodSoft as an Intern.

In this project, I am employing the IRIS dataset to train a machine learning model capable of learning from measurements and accurately classifying Iris flowers into their respective species. Widely used for introductory classification tasks, the IRIS Flower dataset encompasses three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
